  <h2 class="med-header">Reasons Why I Chose Frisco</h2>
  <p>Frisco is my 18 month old cat that is full of energy (3 hours of the day, he sleeps the rest of the time) and sweet. He is my favorite cat and also coincidently my only cat. That is quite convenient isn't it? My mom found him living in a gutter by railroad tracks near her job when he was only a month old. After she learned that her 9 year old cat and him would not get along, she gave me custody. I've loved him from the moment I saw him. Here's why:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>He is cute and adorable</li>
        <li>He speaks, almost too much</li>
        <li>He is fun to be around</li>
      </ul>
