1. Google for atleast 2 good cheat sheets and study them both for introductory understanding of commands.
2. Read a tutorial and jQuery introduction on W3 since it always helps me understand even the most difficult concepts.
3. Check for an additional good resource for another introductory read
4. Check youtube for a sample project being live coded of the latest version of jQuery. Watch 1-2 videos from reputable sources. Code along with atleast 1. 
5. Practice various commands learned from cheat sheet and live coding videos to test skills.
