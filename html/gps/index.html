<!--  1. The purpose of html5 semantic tags are to provide meaning and better descriptors to html sections. They also make the code easier to understand and access for people with disabilities. The ones I see as most useful are nav, section, header, and footer since they are key elements to formatting a web page.
      
      2. The browser displays elements on the web page in the same descending order as it is on the html document.  
      
      3. In this challenge, I learned about the useful tool of creating snippets in Sublime. It was an easy to use tool that I'm sure I'll utilize in the future. 

      4. In this challenge, the most difficult concept was remmebering how to create a table with a merged row or column, without consulting Google. I performed the operation without a stitch last week when I was able to stare at my reference page on how to do it but only remembered parts of the element from memory. It may be good to take time to memorize at least a few essential elements in html for future use. >
