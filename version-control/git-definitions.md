# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a working historical storage of updates to a particular code. It's useful because it helps to better organize and manage the revisions to a code. If an error was made in an older version of the code, version control makes it more efficient to go back and correct it.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a direct copy of it's parent repository. It is used for working on a project/code without disrupting the original file. Once revisions have been reviewed, this branch can be merged with the parent repository to update a file in one sweeping motion.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a file save to the repository, with a message noting what update was done, a unique code, and time stamp of the save. This is a separate action from saving a file locally to your computer. A good commit message begins with a command; such as Add, Fix, Update, etc. It should give a high level summary of the change, be less than 50 characters in length, and not have a period on the end.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is a disconnect that causes a file in two branches of a repository to not be able to combine. Examples of what causes this is one trying to merge an edited file in one branch with another branch where this same file has been deleted. Or if one tries to merge two files with different edits done to the same line.
